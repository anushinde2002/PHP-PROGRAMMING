There are two ways the browser client can send information to the web server.

    The GET Method
    The POST Method

Before the browser sends the information, it encodes it using a scheme called URL 
encoding. 
In this scheme, name/value pairs are joined with equal signs and different pairs 
are separated by the ampersand.

The GET Method

The GET method sends the encoded user information appended to the page request.
The page and the encoded information are separated by the ? character.

The POST Method

The POST method transfers information via HTTP headers. 
The information is encoded as described in case of GET method and put into a 
header called QUERY_STRING.

The $_REQUEST variable

The PHP $_REQUEST variable contains the contents of both $_GET, $_POST, 
and $_COOKIE.
